  "Content": "The cf-release v237 was released on May 14, 2016.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\n- v237 includes a fix for [CVE-2016-3084](http://pivotal.io/security/cve-2016-3084), UAA Password Reset Vulnerability. The mitigation is to upgrade to cf-release v237\n- Diego bridge components are now in CAPI-Release, submoduled into CF-Release. They are removed from Diego release as of [v0.1469.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-release/releases/tag/v0.1469.0) and must be sourced from CF-Release. This will happen automatically for users of Diego manifest generation scripts. Users that generate their Diego deployment manifest manually must make this change now. See \u003ca href='#job-spec-changes'\u003eJob Spec Changes\u003c/a\u003e.\n- As part of moving Diego bridge components to CAPI-Release, properties for bridge components in Diego deployment manifests will be sourced from `properties.capi` in addition to `properties.diego`. We intend to only support `properties.capi` for CF-238. Users of Diego manifest generation scripts can wait for this to happen automatically. Users that generate their Diego deployment manifest manually can make this change now. See \u003ca href='#job-spec-changes'\u003eJob Spec Changes\u003c/a\u003e.\n- properties `router.servers.z1` and `router.servers.z2` have been replaced with a single property `router.servers`. This property is used by the HAProxy job to identify the routers as backends, and by UAA to whitelist requests from the routers.\n- The `domain` that was previously shared by several jobs has been deprecated in favor of `system_domain`\n\n**Contents:**\n- \u003ca href='#cc-and-service-broker-apis'\u003eCC and Service Broker APIs\u003c/a\u003e\n- \u003ca href='#dea-warden-hm9000-runtime'\u003eDEA-Warden-HM9000 Runtime\u003c/a\u003e\n- \u003ca href='#buildpacks-and-stacks'\u003eBuildpacks and Stacks\u003c/a\u003e\n- \u003ca href='#identity'\u003eIdentity\u003c/a\u003e\n- \u003ca href='#routing'\u003eRouting\u003c/a\u003e\n- \u003ca href='#loggregator'\u003eLoggregator\u003c/a\u003e\n- \u003ca href='#internal-components'\u003eInternal Components\u003c/a\u003e\n- \u003ca href='#job-spec-changes'\u003eJob Spec Changes\u003c/a\u003e\n- \u003ca href='#recommended-bosh-stemcell-versions'\u003eRecommended BOSH Stemcell Versions\u003c/a\u003e\n- \u003ca href='#recommended-diego-release-version'\u003eRecommended diego-release Version\u003c/a\u003e\n- \u003ca href='#recommended-garden-linux-release-version'\u003eRecommended garden-linux-release Version\u003c/a\u003e\n- \u003ca href='#recommended-etcd-release-version'\u003eRecommended etcd-release Version\u003c/a\u003e\n- \u003ca href='#recommended-cflinuxfs2-rootfs-release-version'\u003eRecommended cflinuxfs2-rootfs-release Version\u003c/a\u003e\n\n## \u003ca name='cc-and-service-broker-apis'\u003e\u003c/a\u003eCC and Service Broker APIs\n\n**CC API Version: [2.56.0](http://apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/237)**\n\n**Service Broker API Version: [2.8](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/api.html)**\n\n#### [CAPI Release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-release/tree/866b8f8b00820a0f4c14d89147b211b5dc5a70ce)\n- Nginx workers for blobstore should be based on number of CPU cores [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/118954125)\n- Blobstore should use a configurable list of allow / deny directives for internal server.

This defines a more stringent condition than simply `host` exiting 0. `host` will exit `0` even if the `etcd.dns_health_check_host` has MX records associated with it but no A records.
